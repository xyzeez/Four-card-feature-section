## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge was yet another opportunity for me to practice grid and also refresh my grid-layouting skills. Little but worth it!


### Useful resources

- [Philipp Brumm's Shadow Tool](https://shadows.brumm.af/) - I used this to generate the box-shadow below the cards. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
